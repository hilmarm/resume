# My new resume
Here is my brand new CV, made with love and LaTex.

![Developer CV](main.pdf "developer resume")

## Prerequisites

- texlive-full (You can probably get away with texlive-latex-recommended)
- pdflatex

## Install prerequisites on Ubuntu 24.04

```
sudo apt install texlive-latex-full pdflatex
```

## Building pdf

Edit main.tex and add your personal information, skills, employments,
education etc. Then simply build a pdf by running:

```
pdflatex main.tex
```

This will build ``main.pdf``
